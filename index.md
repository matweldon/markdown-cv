## Summary

An innovative, resourceful, pragmatic team leader with 13 years' experience in public sector and government data and analysis, and postdoctorate training in statistics, machine learning and econometrics, I bring creativity, strategic focus, calm leadership and sound judgement to data science projects.

I have worked across the data science stack, from crafting comms, through app development, data engineering and cloud infrastructure, through to machine learning and innovating methods. I understand how to build and communicate successful data science products. My strengths are:

* **Innovation**: I have a strong track record of successful, innovative solutions to difficult statistical and ML problems. These solutions have contributed to award-winning and high-impact products.
* **Product strategy**: I act entrepreneurially over long timescales, nurturing opportunities that can become projects and products. I effectively communicate with stakeholders to understand problems and pitch solutions.
* **Managing people**: I provide the right-sized guidance, coaching and enabling constraints, to complement highly-skilled data scientists and engineers. I nurture a safe culture for continuous improvement.
